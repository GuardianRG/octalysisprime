# Landing on the OP Island

![Congratulations: You've decided to invest in yourself](/resources/investnow.png)

You've arrived on the **Vingilot**. 

In case you were wondering, the Vingilot was the ship in which EÃ¤rendil and Elwing sailed to Aman in order to seek pardon and assistance from the Valar. (This will make more sense if you are a *Lord of the Rings* fan.)

The ship name doesn't affect your Octalysis Prime journey, although it does give a touch of Core Drive 7: Unpredictability & Curiosity as well as a tiny bit of Core Drive 4: Ownership & Possession even before you've booked your ticket to the OP Island. On the occasions when our randomly-generated ship names are recognizable by a new member, we've also created a sense of branding we care about. Many of our members from over 20 countries grew up playing video games, reading science fiction and fantasy, and continue to engage in the zeitgeist of popular culture surrounding these widening fields today. If you must know, Stephen Colbert named his Tesla Model S "Vingilot"--now you know that one of America's news & comedy names is a Lord of the Rings geek and a Tesla driver. Two more facts you didn't know till now.
