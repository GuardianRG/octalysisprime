# Office Hours with Yu-kai Chou

Yu-kai's custom consulting often goes for upwards of $400 with clients, so by joining OP as a Premium member, you're already making a good decision. While you don't get a full hour of Yu-kai's time--you will share that with other members--you will have one-on-one access to ask your question or receive live feedback from Yu-kai on a project in which you are working. 

OP member Mikhil of SonicJobs famously took feedback from an Office Hour session in Autumn of 2019 and implemented new ideas into his product. The result? Significant improvements in new user retention. 

## How do I join? 

Once you are a Premium member, you'll gain access to the Slack community--for reminders--but also, more importantly, the schedule of Office Hours. 

Yu-kai hosts a session with support from Community Manager Erik each Thursday, with 2x sessions on the first Thursday of the month.

## The Schedule

Once a Premium member, you will have access to the schedule where you can personally save reminders to the calendar of your preference.

## What kinds of questions to bring

Yu-kai is yet to be asked a question he did not try to answer. You may ask about his personal life, his previous businesses, The Octalysis Group, anything about the Roadmap of Octalysis Prime, and more importantly, about your own challenge submissions, projects, and business applications. 

With guidance from Yu-kai, members like Bo or Mike have developed blogs (Bo a leading education blog in Denmark, and Mike's on mediation, finneycanhelp.com).
