### EXP Log

Ever wondered how much EXP you are receiving for activities around the Island? 

Look no further than the EXP Log!

Here you will see the activity and how much EXP per each Core Drive, 1 through 8.

Additionally, each Powerup which provided a bonus is indicated by an icon. 

In this example, Iñaki has several Powerups working for him:

## Social 


The top section of the Social tab displays your avatar, octagon, pet, as well as your basic member information, including your member since date, your follower and following counts, and a editable text field to display your status.

Next, your Friends are displayed, including your **Success Buddy**. Use the arrow at the right of the panel to scroll through your Friends.

At the bottom of the Social tab you'll find an area with recent **Messages** and recent **Events**. This is a great place to reply to comments and see if your Friends captured Geomon that you don't have yet.

Now, you may also want to see the payment details of your account. Simply click on **Account Settings**.

### Account Settings

In Account Settings, you can view the email associated with your account, change your password (8-character minimum). 

Also, you can see your current **Billing Information**. 

If desired, you may cancel or pause your account. Sometimes you just need a short break before returning, and Bruna, our Operations Manager, will happily setup a pause and reminder for you at the future date of your choosing. Thanks Bruna!

The main benefits of Premium depend on exactly what your goals are: 

Some members benefit greatly from the Free membership, but also want the private Slack community and the direct contact with Yu-kai during Office Hours. Here's an example of [a recent Office Hours](https://zoom.us/recording/share/Ui8PujK5RWUivT5u99Iqo4-LOcVD8nXsk9l6MEn5yZqwIumekTziMw).

What are your goals and why did you join OP? 

It could be that Premium isn't for you, but perhaps I could dive into a few more of the Premium benefits knowing more about you. Feel free to send an email with your specific questions to erik@chouforce.com and I'll help you make the decision, but the decision is yours!

Before we move on, as a reminder, here is a summary of **Premium benefits**:

A> ##### Premium Benefits

### Can I Decrease My Monthly Payment?

As a matter of fact, Yes.

T> If you want to decrease your monthly payment, one way is to refer new members. Any member you refer which becomes a paying member will decrease your monthly payment permanently by $10.
