# Building an Economy

Oh no! This looks quite empty...

Sad. 

But not really. 

I left this empty space on purpose, hoping to draw your attention. 

This section initially intended to explain much more about how the **Economy** of Octalysis Prime works, and how we built it.

Instead, however, I'd rather invite you to help me build the [OP Wiki](https://octalysisprime.fandom.com/wiki/Octalysis_Prime_Wiki) where we can provide these details to other members who need it. 

*Send an email to erik@chouforce.com if you would like to help. By doing so you will do a great service to every new member who discovers the Octalysis Prime Island.*
