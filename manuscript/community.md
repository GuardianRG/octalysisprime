# The Community

For some members, the Community is a major reason they stay members for as long as they do. Members like Ulric "Xiaogou" Kashige have been with us from the beginning and have contributed much to our culture of friendly yet serious learning. 

Whether on the Island comments (below videos) or in the private Slack group (for Premium members), there are new connections to make and new levels to reach in your Octalysis knowledge. 

## Connect

One of the first things to do in the Slack community is to **Introduce Yourself**. Tell us why you're here. What will you add? What do you hope to learn? 

Treat this community like a local club. Be friendly, helpful, and generous of spirit.

*Remember, you'll need to be a Premium member to gain access to the private Slack community.*

## Learn

There is much to learn from your fellow members, with students and professionals from over 20 countries and numerous job types and industries. 

Message me, @erikvanmechelen on Slack to have me connect you with someone in your field. This doesn't always lead to a new friend or colleague, but sometimes these connections create new networks of possibility in the future.

## Grow

In the second Food Heroes Challenge, about 10 members joined the Food Heroes channel in Slack and worked together, sharing their ideas and questions as they developed their submissions. This was great to see, especially since you wouldn't expect people to work together on a competitive challenge where the reward was a trip to Shanghai to work with the Food Heroes team. 

And yet, in OP, things are sometimes different--in a good way--from the 'real' world. 

I hope you'll have experiences like this, too, or help to create them for others. 

## Teach

Ulric commented in an Office Hour session that even when he doesn't win a Challenge, he knows he has improved his gamification knowledge and the application of that knowledge. Such an understanding is invaluable (priceless) when seeking personal growth. We welcome moments of inspiration like this, and even have a place to share them in #Member-Wins. 

Thank you for teaching us all, Ulric.
