# Gotta Catch'em ___ 

Yu-kai's friend NAME.LASTNAME created a game called GAMENAME with Geomons. 

The game was sold to Yahoo in YEAR.DATE, but Yahoo shut the game down. NAME.LASTNAME said Yu-kai could use the IP in Octalysis Prime. 

Ever since Yu-kai's release of Actionable Gamification: Beyond Points, Badges, & Leaderboards, readers and fans have asked for the complete list of Game Techniques referred to in the pages. We all seem to bow to mystery (Core Drive 7: Unpredictability & Curiosity). 

Here on the Island of Octalysis Prime, Yu-kai saw an opportunity to bring the Geomons to life and also serve the desire to learn more about the Game Techniques. 

(Express that Yu-kai is constantly working on these, developing new ones for clients through The Octalysis Group)

The first Geomon to arrive on the Island was BLANK

Today there are more than 40 Geomon on the Island.

As there are more than 150 Game Techniques in Yu-kai's secret list, there are surely more Geomon to come!

Dedicated member Iñaki and others have created their own lists for their personal enjoyment and curiosity, however, more and more members are seeing that simply by capturing additional Geomon, they can not only be exposed to the Game Techniques but also, by using the Geomon Album located in their Inventory, learn how to use these Game Techniques through repeated exposure or spaced repetition.

## Where to Find Geomon

Each Geomon prefers a certain terrain (land / air / water) and habitat (Applied Psychology, Battleground, Behavioral Economics, Challenges, Community, Case Jungle, Entrepreneurship and Business, Gameful Design, Motivational Psychology, Persuasive Technology, Technology Platforms, Yu-kai Travels). 

There are a several underground details which we may share later, but you might be interested in the probability of encountering a certain Rarity of Geomon. 

| Rarity  | Distribution  |
|---|---|---|
| Common | 30%  |
| Rare  | 15%  |
| Epic  | 5%  |
| Mystical  | 1%  |
| Legendary  | 0.2%  |


## Animations

Certain Mystical Geomon have what we like to call victory poses or simply animations which bring an exciting visual element. 

When you set a Mystical as a pet, it will manifest in the lower-right of your avatar and continue to animate. You can see what other members have added as pets in the Social tab of your Companion.

**Rules**

- Choosing a Geomon as a pet will give the player some XP boost
- The boost is a function of the Geomon RARITY, MODIFIER and DOMINANT CDs
- The MODIFIERS are a function of the number of that particular Geomon set as a Geomon pet by any user
- The final XP boost should be applied to all DOMINANT CDs of that particular Geomon (rounded up)
- Every pet Geomon will have a STAMINA associated with it - the time that geomon will remain active as a pet
- Every pet Geomon will have a RESTING associated with it - the time before you can choose that same Geomon as your pet again

**Geomon Rarity**

| Rarity  | EXP  |
|---|---|
| Common  | 5%  |
| Rare  | 10%  |
| Epic  | 15%  |
| Mystical  | 25%  |
| Legendary  | 50%  |

**Geomon Stamina**

Keep in mind that your pet Geomons need to rest! 

| Rarity  | Stamina  | Resting  |
|---|---|---|
| Common  | 6 hours  | 1 day  |
| Rare  | 12 hours  | 2 days  |
| Epic  | 24 hours  | 5 days  |
| Mystical  | 48 hours  | 10 days  |
| Legendary  | 72 hours  | 30 days  |

Getting in the habit of keeping a good rotation of Geomons will ensure you benefit from their EXP bonuses. 

If your Geomon are not sleeping so well, you could try an Octalysis pillow.

**Geomon Scarcity Modifier**

If many other users have set the same type of Geomon as a pet, then your Geomon will be less effective. In other words, paying attention to which Geomons other members are setting as a pet will allow you to choose a less-used Geomon and improve your modifier.

| # Geomon as pet  | Modifer  |
|---|---|
| 1  | 2x  |
| 2  | 1.6x  |
| 3  | 1.4x  |
| 4-5  | 1.2x  |
| 6-9  | 1.1x  |
| 10+  | 1x  |






## Set the Trap

> Tries: 3 out of 3
> This is your last day and the trap hasn’t captured anything yet.

> IMPORTANT: If the trap captures a geomon, you will have 48 hours to get it out of the trap and into your collection or it will escape!

Notice in the above that this trap attempt is 3 out of 3 (the previous attempts haven't captured a geomon).
