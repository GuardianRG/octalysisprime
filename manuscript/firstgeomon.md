# Gotta Catch'em ___ 

Ever since Yu-kai's release of *Actionable Gamification: Beyond Points, Badges, & Leaderboards*, readers and fans have asked for the complete list of **Game Techniques** referred to in the pages. We all seem to bow to mystery (Core Drive 7: Unpredictability & Curiosity). 

Here on the Island of Octalysis Prime, Yu-kai saw an opportunity to bring the **Geomons** to life and also serve the desire to learn more about the Game Techniques. 

You might be wondering where the Geomons came from. Well, it was actually Yu-kai's friend Ivan Lee created a game called Geomon, which Yahoo purchased but shut down. He told Yu-kai should he ever want the IP for a project related to Octalysis that he'd be open to that. 

And so the Geomons live on! 

As of early 2020, Today there are more than 40 Geomon on the Island.

As there are more than 150 Game Techniques in Yu-kai's secret list, there are surely more Geomon to come!

Dedicated member IÃ±aki and others have created their own lists for their personal enjoyment and curiosity, however, more and more members are seeing that simply by capturing additional Geomon, they can not only be exposed to the Game Techniques but also, by using the Geomon Album located in their Inventory, learn how to use these Game Techniques through repeated exposure or spaced repetition. 


## Collecting Geomon (The Album)

One of the most exciting parts of Octalysis Prime is seeing the discovery of new Geomons. Like Darwin's theory of evolution, it seems our OP explorers will continue to unearth new species.

Face off, win the Challenge.

After you successfully capture a Geomon, it's time to have a look at your **Geomon Album**, which can be found in your Companion's **Items** tab.

Once you are viewing your Geomon Album, you will have several options available to you. 

First, take a breath and a moment to enjoy the Geomon collection you have acquired. It isn't easy work capturing Geomon! Take it in.

Okay, now that you've enjoyed that, let's see what you can do here. 

### Release 

One way to get additional CD1 EXP is to release a Geomon. As I have 4 Cottles in the below example, I am comfortable setting one of them free.

### Sell

You can sell your Geomons for Chou Coins. The Geomon dealers will offer you a price based upon the relative scarcity of that Geomon in the wild. 

Once you select **Sell** from the green symbol on the Geomon Card, you will have 60 seconds to consider the deal at that price. You can check the price an unlimited number of times.

### Merge

Once you unlock the Core Drive 6 Purple Powerup--**Geomon Merger**--you gain the ability to merge 3 Geomons of the same kind to get a new, rarer Geomon.

This is something to look forward to if you are still a new arrival to the OP Island experience.

## Where to Find Geomon

Each Geomon prefers a certain terrain (land / air / water) and habitat (Applied Psychology, Battleground, Behavioral Economics, Challenges, Community, Case Jungle, Entrepreneurship and Business, Gameful Design, Motivational Psychology, Persuasive Technology, Technology Platforms, Yu-kai Travels). 

There are a several underground details which we may share later, but you might be interested in the probability of encountering a certain Rarity of Geomon. 

| Rarity  | Distribution  |
|---|---|---|
| Common | 30%  |
| Rare  | 15%  |
| Epic  | 5%  |
| Mystical  | 1%  |
| Legendary  | 0.2%  |

### Improving Your Chances

Perhaps the best way to improve your chances of capturing more Geomon is to **Set Traps**. 

![There are several types of traps](/resources/traps.png)

Once you've set your trap, pay attention each day to see if you catch a Geomon. 

![Try Setting a Trap](/resources/trapset.png)

Notice in the above that this trap attempt is 3 out of 3 (the previous attempts haven't captured a geomon). 

## Animations

Certain Mystical Geomon have what we like to call victory poses or simply animations which bring an exciting visual element. 

When you set a Mystical as a pet, it will manifest in the lower-right of your avatar and continue to animate. You can see what other members have added as pets in the Social tab of your Companion.

## Pets

You love your Geomons, so why not set one of them as a **Pet**? Simply click the the **Gray Heart** to activate a Geomon as a Pet.  

Now let's next take a look at the Rules, Rarity, Stamina, and Modifiers for Geomons.

**Rules**

- Choosing a Geomon as a pet will give the player some XP boost
- The boost is a function of the Geomon RARITY, MODIFIER and DOMINANT CDs
- The MODIFIERS are a function of the number of that particular Geomon set as a Geomon pet by any user
- The final XP boost should be applied to all DOMINANT CDs of that particular Geomon (rounded up)
- Every pet Geomon will have a STAMINA associated with it - the time that geomon will remain active as a pet
- Every pet Geomon will have a RESTING associated with it - the time before you can choose that same Geomon as your pet again
- If you have the Pet Fanny Pack Powerup, you can assign multiple Geomons as pets

**Geomon Rarity**

| Rarity  | EXP  |
|---|---|
| Common  | 5%  |
| Rare  | 10%  |
| Epic  | 15%  |
| Mystical  | 25%  |
| Legendary  | 50%  |

**Geomon Stamina**

Keep in mind that your pet Geomons need to rest! 

![My Harpy needs its rest](/resources/harpysleep.png)

Getting in the habit of keeping a good rotation of Geomons will ensure you benefit from their EXP bonuses. 

| Rarity  | Stamina  | Resting  |
|---|---|---|
| Common  | 6 hours  | 1 day  |
| Rare  | 12 hours  | 2 days  |
| Epic  | 24 hours  | 5 days  |
| Mystical  | 48 hours  | 10 days  |
| Legendary  | 72 hours  | 30 days  |

If your Geomon are not sleeping so well, you could try an Octalysis pillow.

**Geomon Scarcity Modifier**

If many other users have set the same type of Geomon as a pet, then your Geomon will be less effective. In other words, paying attention to which Geomons other members are setting as a pet will allow you to choose a less-used Geomon and improve your modifier.

| # Geomon as pet  | Modifer  |
|---|---|
| 1  | 2x  |
| 2  | 1.6x  |
| 3  | 1.4x  |
| 4-5  | 1.2x  |
| 6-9  | 1.1x  |
| 10+  | 1x  |
