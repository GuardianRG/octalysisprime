# Gotta Catch'em ___ 

Yu-kai's friend NAME.LASTNAME created a game called GAMENAME with Geomons. 

The game was sold to Yahoo in YEAR.DATE, but Yahoo shut the game down. NAME.LASTNAME said Yu-kai could use the IP in Octalysis Prime. 

Ever since Yu-kai's release of Actionable Gamification: Beyond Points, Badges, & Leaderboards, readers and fans have asked for the complete list of Game Techniques referred to in the pages. We all seem to bow to mystery (Core Drive 7: Unpredictability & Curiosity). 

Here on the Island of Octalysis Prime, Yu-kai saw an opportunity to bring the Geomons to life and also serve the desire to learn more about the Game Techniques. 

(Express that Yu-kai is constantly working on these, developing new ones for clients through The Octalysis Group)

The first Geomon to arrive on the Island was BLANK

Today there are more than 40 Geomon on the Island.

As there are more than 150 Game Techniques in Yu-kai's secret list, there are surely more Geomon to come!

Dedicated member IÃ±aki and others have created their own lists for their personal enjoyment and curiosity, however, more and more members are seeing that simply by capturing additional Geomon, they can not only be exposed to the Game Techniques but also, by using the Geomon Album located in their Inventory, learn how to use these Game Techniques through repeated exposure or spaced repetition.
