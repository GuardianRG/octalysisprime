# The Community

For some members, the Community is a major reason they stay members for as long as they do. Members like Ulric "Xiaogou" Kashige have been with us from the beginning and have contributed much to our culture of friendly yet serious learning. 

Whether on the Island comments (below videos) or in the private Slack group (for Premium members), there are new connections to make and new levels to reach in your Octalysis knowledge. 

## Connect

One of the first things to do in the Slack community is to **Introduce Yourself**. Tell us why you're here. What will you add? What do you hope to learn? 

Treat this community like a local club. Be friendly, helpful, and generous of spirit.

Work together on Challenges.

Like the #FoodHeroes channel.

Link to blog post I will make about Mart√≠n's winning submission.

Ulric commented in an Office Hour session that even when he doesn't win, he knows he has improved his gamification knowledge and the application of that knowledge. Such an understanding is invaluable (priceless) when seeking personal growth. We welcome moments of inspiration like this, and even have a place to share them in #Member-Wins.
