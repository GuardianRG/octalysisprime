# Your Octalysis Companion

![Your Companion is Free!](/resources/freecompanion.png)

After you've unlocked your Octalysis Companion (by completing the Onboarding drag-and-drop puzzles), you have opened up several new beneficial areas. 

These are: 

1. **News**

2. **Stats**

3. **Items**

4. **Social**

5. **Profile**

This section of the guide will give you more information about each of these 'tabs' within the Companion. 

## News

The News section is a great place to find new videos released by Yu-kai and Howie, our amazing video editor.

You can also switch over to the **Conversations** to see what members are discussing in the **Comments** section below every video. 

![What are your fellow members discussing?](/resources/conversation.png)

## Stats

Your EXP gain across the 8 Core Drives helps to track your progress through your OP Island Experience. When you reach Level 10 in an Core Drive, you will **unlock the Powerup** corresponding to that Core Drive within that Color Status. 

![I've reached Purple Status, and there's still more to see!](/resources/stats.png)

### EXP Log

Ever wondered how much EXP you are receiving for activities around the Island? 

Look no further than the EXP Log!

Here you will see the activity and how much EXP per each Core Drive, 1 through 8. Additionally, each Powerup which provided a bonus is indicated by an icon.

In the above example, Iñaki has several Powerups working for him.

Remember, you can collect EXP for: 

- Watching videos
- Commenting on videos
- Welcoming a new member
- Getting upvotes on your Challenge submissions
- Releasing Geomon into the wild
- ...and much more!


### Powerups

Later in this guide you will find an entire section detailing each of the **Powerups**. 

The Powerups bring a great amount of Core Drive 3: Empowerment of Creativity & Feedback to the Octalysis Prime experience because they let you play the game in completely different ways that suit your strategy and personality.

T> ##### Access Your Powerups!

T> To see what Powerups await you, click on the **Big Button** in the **Stats** tab of your Companion.

## Items

Items augment the Island experience and add new strategic elements. 

We recently added **Downloadable Items**, an entirely new Category of Item, to go along with **Geomon Traps**, **Potions**, and **Magic Items**.

### Store

Once you click over into the **Store** tab (separate from your Inventory), you will see several Categories of Items to purchase. 

Use the Blue Question Marks to find out more about an Item. 

![Which Items will you purchase?](/resources/store.png)

Once you purchase an Item, click over into the **Inventory** to use the Item.

### Inventory 

Whether a consumable item like a **Potion** or a reusable Item (for example, the Downloadable Item, Actionable Gamification...that's right, Yu-kai's book is an Item!), you will find it in your Inventory.

Occasionally, by watching a video, you will be rewarded with a **Downloadable Item** in your Inventory. So check back here to see what you've earned over time. 

![Here's where you Use your Items](/resources/inventory.png)

## Social 

The top section of the Social tab displays your avatar, octagon, pet, as well as your basic member information, including your member since date, your follower and following counts, and a editable text field to display your status.

Next, your Friends are displayed, including your **Success Buddy**. Use the arrow at the right of the panel to scroll through your Friends.

![Check replies to comments in videos](/resources/socialmessages.png)

At the bottom of the Social tab you'll find an area with recent **Messages** and recent **Events**. This is a great place to reply to comments and see if your Friends captured Geomon that you don't have yet.

![Notice the Geomons my friends caught](/resources/socialevents.png)

Remember to show your **heart** in the comments. 

![Show kindness and heart with fellow members.](/resources/heart.png)

What would you like to see changed about the Social tab? Email erik@chouforce.com. 

## Profile

The Profile allows you to change your Avatar and customize it to your liking. Additionally, you may updated your name, country, industry, profession, Hobby, and of course your Super Power. 

If you change anything, remember to click Save at the bottom right.

![My profile](/resources/profile.png)

Now, you may also want to see the payment details of your account. Simply click on **Account Settings**.

### Account Settings

In Account Settings, you can view the email associated with your account, change your password (8-character minimum). 

Also, you can see your current **Billing Information**. 

If desired, you may cancel or pause your account. Sometimes you just need a short break before returning, and Bruna, our Operations Manager, will happily setup a pause and reminder for you at the future date of your choosing. Thanks Bruna!

Additionally, you may consider **Changing your Subscription Plan** to take advantage of Premium benefits or to save money with a Yearly membership.

![Monthly and Yearly Plans (best value)](/resources/changesubscription.png)

The main benefits of Premium depend on exactly what your goals are: 

Some members benefit greatly from the Free membership, but also want the private Slack community and the direct contact with Yu-kai during Office Hours. Here's an example of [a recent Office Hours](https://zoom.us/recording/share/Ui8PujK5RWUivT5u99Iqo4-LOcVD8nXsk9l6MEn5yZqwIumekTziMw).

What are your goals and why did you join OP? 

It could be that Premium isn't for you, but perhaps I could dive into a few more of the Premium benefits knowing more about you. Feel free to send an email with your specific questions to erik@chouforce.com and I'll help you make the decision, but the decision is yours!

Before we move on, as a reminder, here is a summary of **Premium benefits**:

A> ##### Premium Benefits
A>
A> - Access to All 500+ videos and counting! [and unlimited viewing time]
A> - Gain entry into weekly Office Hours with Yu-kai for custom consulting
A> - Private Slack Community with passionate and supportive members
A> - Enter the Prestigious Octalysis Design Challenges (like Food Heroes)
A> - Claim your Octalysis Level I & II Certificates

### Can I Decrease My Monthly Payment?

As a matter of fact, Yes.

If you want to decrease your monthly payment, one way is to refer new members. Any member you refer which becomes a paying member will decrease your monthly payment permanently by $10.

![When your referee becomes a paid member](referral.png)

T> ##### Get OP Free Forever
T> 
T> Assume you are on a $50/month membership. If you refer 1 new member who becomes a paying member, you reduce your monthly payment to $40/month. If you successfully refer 5, you will have OP **free forever**. That is hard to do, but it might be worth the effort.

*As always, if you have questions, email erik@chouforce.com or check out the [OP Wiki](https://octalysisprime.fandom.com/wiki/Octalysis_Prime_Wiki).*
