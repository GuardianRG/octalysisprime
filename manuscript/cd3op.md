# Building OP with CD3

From a gamified work perspective, Yu-kai and I have worked together to find not only this Key Performance Metric, but also an understanding of how we work together--he supporting my work, and I offering new ideas and executing them--which involves a conversation about how my role should revolve around and evolve with respect to that KPI, all the while maintaining a certain level of autonomy and creativity (CD3). The development of this Wiki has come about precisely as a result of this conversation we have as employer-employee. Yu-kai said, in a meeting, "I think it's time for a Wiki," and I said, "I think I'd like to dig into that, and I think all of you (my teammates) should contribute to it, but I'd like to get started on it." And so the Wiki was conceived. Now, in keeping with this same "conversation" around how we gamify our work, the duration in time between conception and birth of this Wiki should be minimal. How it looks and feels from the moment of its birth going forward, as it grows, should also change. 

Maybe you'd like an example of how the Wiki will change over time. Well, if you read an early version of the Wiki (the OP FAQ), you probably noticed numerous gaps. You might have thought, Why is the OP team emphasizing this set of questions (geared toward new members) rather than describing the intricacies of later stage Powerups? And this was a good question. Well, without directly answering why we did that, you will see that this Wiki does indeed include lengthy discussions about each of the Powerups. 

(One of our hesitations about publishing overly much about Octalysis Prime Strategy--that is, how to best gain EXP, how to best acquire Chou Coins and join the 1%, or how to best learn about gamification so as to complete your Octalysis Level I or Level II Certificate--is that we didn't want to steal our members' destinies. For some player types, there is irreplaceable value in the discovery of a path he or she wants to take around and through the Island. In writing this Wiki, we believe that most of this explorer player type will not spend too much time in this Wiki, because they won't need it to have an energizing and motivating experience. However, perhaps you, who read this now, are among the player types who enjoy having some guidance...When the Student is ready, the Teacher appears...maybe you see this Wiki as a kind of teacher.)

Prime On!

See you on the Island. 

Sincerely, 

Erik van Mechelen
