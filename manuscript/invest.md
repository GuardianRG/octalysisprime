# Invest In Yourself

Investing in yourself one of the best decisions you can make. 

It is also quite hard to know when it is the right time to improve your craft, and when is the right time to show your skills in public. 

Fortunately, you don't really get to choose. You have to do BOTH, practice and perform, at all times. That is part of the nature of life.

In [Octalysis Prime](https://octalysisprime.com), we recognize this tension and provide bite-sized videos that you can place into the niches and nooks of your busy day. The average video is about 10 minutes, though if you are looking to dive deep, Yu-kai has done longer videos, including a recording of a live online 3-day workshop as well as extended book osmosis of Daniel Kahneman's *Thinking, Fast & Slow*.

I didn't write this guide all by myself. Whenever you see the above image, the idea expressed is my imaginative interpretation of our Octalysis Prime Chief Mentor, Yu-kai. 

In fact, you might be wondering about a few other members on the team, like Jun, Tiago, Bruna, Leo, Howie, Kevin, Tim and Dirk. In the language of RPGs, this is quite the party!
