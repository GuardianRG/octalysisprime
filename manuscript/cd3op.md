# Building OP with CD3

One of our hesitations about publishing overly much about Octalysis Prime Strategy--that is, how to best gain EXP, how to best acquire Chou Coins and join the 1%, or how to best learn about gamification so as to complete your Octalysis Level I or Level II Certificate--is that we didn't want to steal our members' destinies. 

For some player types, there is irreplaceable value in the discovery of a path he or she wants to take around and through the Island. In writing this Guide, we believe that most of this explorer player type will not spend too much time in this Guide, because they won't need it to have an energizing and motivating experience. 

However, perhaps you, who read this now, are among the player types who enjoy having some guidance...When the Student is ready, the Teacher appears...maybe you see this Guide as a kind of teacher.

Prime On!

See you on the [Octalysis Prime](https://octalysisprime.com) Island. 

Sincerely, 

Erik van Mechelen
